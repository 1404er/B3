#### 2.1 Create A BestBuy account if you don't have one. If you do, make a new one for the bot or use your own.

#### 3.1 Run B3setup.bat
#### 3.2 Follow the prompts.
#### 3.3 During the check you might see a prompt from BestBuy asking for email and or phone confirmation. You must click and allow the sign in.
#### 3.4 When the verification check is done, Close the window.
#### 3.5 Go to C:\B3 again.
